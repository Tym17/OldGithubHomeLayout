# Github home's old columns layout
Places the newsfeed on the left side of the page like it was before so your repositories are shown on the right.

Now it looks like this:
![current layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tym17/OldGithubHomeLayout/master/media/newlayout.PNG?token=ALrspOMEJkd0PS-CCYK6kbposgd3VYVjks5bCSHZwA%3D%3D)

With this extension it will look like this again:
![old layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tym17/OldGithubHomeLayout/master/media/oldlayout.PNG?token=ALrspIr1r41QyzVSfKnvO0FJQ33DdhLCks5bCSHawA%3D%3D)
